			<h1>The girl in byakkoya</h1>
			<p> In the distant sky, twirling flowers form a clamorous circle.
And it wakes up the turnig point you passed through on that day, on that day.
In a form of a shimmer, you chase the girl who points the way.
Then you find a nameless and nostalgic field on a hill. </p>

<p> "That is the city I let you see in your dream", whispered a shadow.
Day after day , day after day, when you have passed through countless turning points,
a sage in the dimness will collect discarded days.
Along the shore, along the shore, he makes an unknown flame dance. </p>

<p> Ah mantle loquaciously throws up a flame
to congratulate the person who stands on the abandoned field.
Ah in the girl's silent, silent view,
Ah lights begin to shine in the unseen city. </p>

<p> High up in the sky, dyed in vermillion, clouds arise like a fire burning.
It shows you the way you lost on that day, on that day.
Chasing the wind blowing repeatedly in your dream, you go down the flow of time.
Along the river, along the river, you saw an unknown flower of felicity. </p>
